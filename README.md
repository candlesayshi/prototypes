Some audio ideas and experiments

## in progress
* **shatter**

    Based on an idea I have about splitting an audiofile into a number of layers that play with and over each other in algorithmically determined loops. I originally came up with the idea while working on programming a parallel multi-delay effect, and thought I would use the same concepts for this, but have decided to eschew it for a more straight-forward implementation.
