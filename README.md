Some audio ideas and experiments

* **shatter**

    Based on an idea I have about splitting an audiofile into a number of layers that play with and over each other in algorithmically determined loops. I originally came up with the idea while working on programming a parallel multi-delay effect, and thought I would use the same concepts for this, but have decided to eschew it for a more straight-forward implementation.

* **weave**

    I wanted a delay where the manipulation of internal signals and routing of feedback was the main thing behind it. So, that's where this idea came about. I really want it as a VST, but I thought I would prototype it with a command-line program first and then port it as a plugin. That'll take time, obviously, but I'm excited to hear how it comes together.
